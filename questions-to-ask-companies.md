##Questions to Ask Companies

###Though every company, candidate, and circumstance are different, the following questions generally serve as a good place to start when thinking of what to ask companies (and make sure to have several questions to pose to them, or that's typically a strike against you!)

*General questions:* 
* What opportunities for mentorship are available at XYZ Company? 
* What would my main responsibilities be (should be stated in the ad, but sometimes not; even if so, you can go into more detail)?
* Which product/product line are you most proud of? Why? 
* What professional development opportunities are there in the company (things like conference funding, code retreats, etc)?
* Where do you see the company in five years? 

*Code:*
* Do you test? If so, which framework(s) do you use? 
* Why are you using the framework/language/libraries that you use? 
* To your knowledge, what is one of the toughest technical problems that your company/unit has faced, and how have you overcome it? 
* Tell me a little about your linting and the code best practices that your company employs. 
* What are some learning opportunities that I would have at XYZ Company? (maybe go into detail about specifics like React depending on the circumstance)

*Agile/Teamwork:* 
* How long is your sprint cycle, typically? 
* What tool(s) do you use for version control, and why? 
* What is your pull review process like? 
* Do your developers do most of their programming individually, in pairs, in larger teams, or in some other way? 
* Would I have many other developers with whom I would be working (as opposed to being the only or almost the only dev in the company/unit)
* (If remote) How often would I interact with colleagues? What forms would evaluations take? 

*Other*:
* What do you see as the best aspect of working at XYZ Company?
* (As appropriate) How does your company fit in with/contribute to the larger community?
